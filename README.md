# Analysis of Financial Dataset fot Fraud Detection

## Importance of this problem

Nowadays, in our modern society, we find ourselves rarely using cash. Our money transactions are more likely to be digital, i.e. credit cards, bank transfers, app transfers, etc. It is very effortless and convenient to carry out all these tasks in the comfort of our home. However, this advance in technology can also generate great discomfort. Thieves are getting more creative, and we see that digital financial fraud is increasing day by day, minute by minute. Hence, staying ahead of these con artists is essential. One way of doing this is to generate accurate models that can predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

To tackle this problem, I used Machine Learning to predict and detect digital fraud. During this analysis I will try to answer questions like:

- What is the most fraudulent transaction type?
- Is there a most common time of day fraudulent activities are carried out?

## Dataset Source
This data set ("Synthetic financial datasets for fraud detection") was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1/data)

This is a synthetic financial dataset that "simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country".
